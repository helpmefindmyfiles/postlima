I recently decrypted my hard-drive that was linked to my LIMA device.... After a day of decryping I got the greenlight that it was complete. Upon clicking through my harddrive I realized that non of my folders were completely empty. I havent deinstalled LIMA and I'm running on MAC... is there anyway to recover my files? HELP!
